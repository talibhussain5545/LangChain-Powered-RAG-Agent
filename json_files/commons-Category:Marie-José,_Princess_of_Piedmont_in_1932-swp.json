It is in the public domain there because its copyright term has expired. According to Law for the Protection of Copyright and Neighbouring Rights n.633, 22 April 1941 and later revisions, images of people or of aspects, elements and facts of natural or social life, obtained with photographic process or with an analogue one, including reproductions of figurative art and film frames of film stocks (Art. 87) are protected for a period of 20 years from creation (Art. 92). This provision shall not apply to photographs of writings, documents, business papers, material objects, technical drawings and similar products (Art. 87). Italian law makes an important distinction between \"works of photographic art\" and \"simple photographs\" (Art. 2, \u00a7 7). Photographs that are \"intellectual work with creative characteristics\" are protected for 70 years after the author's death (Art. 32 bis), whereas simple photographs are protected for a period of 20 years from creation.\n\nItaly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis may not apply in countries that don't apply the rule of the shorter term to works from Italy.
