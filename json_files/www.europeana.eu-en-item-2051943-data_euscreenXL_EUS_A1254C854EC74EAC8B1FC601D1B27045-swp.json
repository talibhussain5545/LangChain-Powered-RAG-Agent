Because of his attitude towards the Germans during the Second World War, King Leopold III has become controversial in Belgium. Leopold's brother, Prince regent Karel has performed as king since the liberation of Belgium in 1944 and when Leopold was in German confinement. The people of Belgium can express their feelings in the plebiscite about the possible return of Leopold to the throne.", "og:type": "article", "og:image": "https://api.europeana.eu/thumbnail/v3/400/18a84da47d96154a2484c593f2b21641"}, "text": " \n    Publisher\n    \n          Polygoon Wereldnieuws\n        \n    Subject\n    \n          Society and social issues\n        \n          Koningshuis\n        \n          REGERING\n        \n          oorlogsverleden\n        \n          omstreden\n        \n    Society\n  \n    Type of item\n    \n          ITEM\n        \n          News\n          \n    Publisher\n    \n          Polygoon Wereldnieuws\n        \n    Subject\n    \n          Society and social issues\n        \n          Koningshuis\n        \n          REGERING\n        \n          oorlogsverleden\n        \n          omstreden\n        \n    Society\n  \n    Type of item\n    \n          ITEM\n        \n          News\n        \n    Providing institution\n    \n    Netherlands Institute for Sound & Vision\n  \n    Aggregator\n    \n    EUscreen\n  \n    Rights statement for the media in this item (unless otherwise specified)\n    \n          http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/\n        \n    Rights\n    \n          For information on the use of archive material, please contact the Customer Service department of the Netherlands Institute for Sound & Vision: [email\u00a0protected].\n        \n    Creation date\n    \n          1950\n        \n    1950\n  \n    Issue date\n    \n          01/03/1950\n        \n    1950-03-01\n  \n    Places\n    \n          Belgium\n        \n    Belgium\n  \n    Belgium\n  \n    United Nations\n  \n    Identifier\n    \n          VA_SV20090316105418415\n        \n          http://mint-projects.image.ntua.gr/data/euscreenXL/EUS_A1254C854EC74EAC8B1FC601D1B27045\n        \n    Extent\n    \n          00:00:45\n        \n    Format\n    \n          ASPECT RATIO:\n        \n          Black & White\n        \n          VIDEO\n        \n    Language\n    \n          Dutch; Flemish\n        \n          vls\n        \n          nld\n        \n    Is part of\n    \n          Europeana XX: Century of Change\n        \n    Year\n    \n          1950\n        \n    Providing country\n    \n          Europe\n        \n    Collection name\n    \n          2051943_Ag_EU_OldEUscreen_1025\n        \n    First time published on Europeana\n    \n          2023-07-27T14:19:15.224Z\n        \n    Last time updated from providing institution\n    \n          2023-07-27T14:19:15.224Z\n          "}]
