Italian law makes an important distinction between \"works of photographic art\" and \"simple photographs\" (Art. 2, \u00a7 7). Photographs that are \"intellectual work with creative characteristics\" are protected for 70 years after the author's death (Art. 32 bis), whereas simple photographs are protected for a period of 20 years from creation.\n\nItaly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis may not apply in countries that don't apply the rule of the shorter term to works from Italy. In particular, these are in the public domain in the United States only if:\nwasn't in copyright in the United States due to being registered for copyright there (see Commons:Copyright tags#United States for most cases) and\nwas created prior to 1976 and published prior to 1978 \u2014 then it was out-of-copyright in Italy on the URAA date of restoration (January 1, 1996) (17 U.S.C. \u00a7 104A) (in most cases; for all cases, see Template:PD-Italy/US). If so, please add {{PD-1996}} in addition to this copyright tag. If the image was created after 1975 or was published after 1977, please add {{Not-PD-US-URAA}}.\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629\u00a0\u2219 catal\u00e0\u00a0\u2219 Deutsch\u00a0\u2219 English\u00a0\u2219 espa\u00f1ol\u00a0\u2219 fran\u00e7ais\u00a0\u2219 magyar\u00a0\u2219 italiano\u00a0\u2219 \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u00a0\u2219 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u00a0\u2219 portugu\u00eas\u00a0\u2219 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439\u00a0\u2219 sicilianu\u00a0\u2219 \u4e2d\u6587\u00a0\u2219 \u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7b80\u4f53\uff09\u00a0\u2219 \u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u7e41\u9ad4\uff09\u00a0\u2219 \u4e2d\u6587\uff08\u81fa\u7063\uff09\u00a0\u2219 +/\u2212\n\n\n\n\nPublic domainPublic domainfalsefalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work is in the public domain in its country of origin and other countries and areas where the copyright term is the author's life plus 70 years or fewer.\n\n\n You must also include a United States public domain tag to indicate why this work is in the public domain in the United States.\u00a0Note that a few countries have copyright terms longer than 70 years: Mexico has 100 years, Jamaica has 95 years, Colombia has 80 years, and Guatemala and Samoa have 75 years.
