It is in the public domain there because its copyright term has expired. According to Law for the Protection of Copyright and Neighbouring Rights n.633, 22 April 1941 and later revisions, images of people or of aspects, elements and facts of natural or social life, obtained with photographic process or with an analogue one, including reproductions of figurative art and film frames of film stocks (Art. 87) are protected for a period of 20 years from creation (Art. 92). This provision shall not apply to photographs of writings, documents, business papers, material objects, technical drawings and similar products (Art. 87). Italian law makes an important distinction between \"works of photographic art\" and \"simple photographs\" (Art. 2, \u00a7 7). Photographs that are \"intellectual work with creative characteristics\" are protected for 70 years after the author's death (Art. 32 bis), whereas simple photographs are protected for a period of 20 years from creation.\n\nItaly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis may not apply in countries that don't apply the rule of the shorter term to works from Italy. In particular, these are in the public domain in the United States only if:\nwasn't in copyright in the United States due to being registered for copyright there (see Commons:Copyright tags#United States for most cases) and\nwas created prior to 1976 and published prior to 1978 \u2014 then it was out-of-copyright in Italy on the URAA date of restoration (January 1, 1996) (17 U.S.C. \u00a7 104A) (in most cases; for all cases, see Template:PD-Italy/US). If so, please add {{PD-1996}} in addition to this copyright tag.
